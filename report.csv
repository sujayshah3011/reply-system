If you’re familiar with MCP (Model Context Protocol), you know it allowed apps to send structured context to LLMs — kind of like plugging your app directly into an AI brain. A2A takes it further.

You’re pitching V1 like it’s a rocket ship, knowing full well it’s held together by duct tape and caffeine. And still, you believe. You have to be a little bit delusional to be a great founder. But you also have to be honest enough to admit when your baby’s not quite ready for the photo album.  That’s where the magic is bold belief with brutal honesty. Build the thing. Fix the weird-looking parts. Keep going. hashtag#Startups hashtag#Founders hashtag#BuildInPublic hashtag#DelusionalButRight hashtag#FounderLife","William, this is a fantastic post!
